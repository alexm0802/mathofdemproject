initiate everything, and create arrays of counties, population, and %rep
deal with the counties that are super big, and create a few districts...
create 5 random district combinations, and calculate scores for them
combine best 2 district combinations into 1 map
mutate that map into 5 ones, and repeat previous three steps

issues:
creating the random maps: making sure population matches
combining maps
calculating scores (whatever we choose for this to mean)
